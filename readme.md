# Material point phase field methods

This repository contains matlab source code for material point methods with the option of performing elastic, elasto-plastic or brittle fracture analysis via the phase field method.

If you find MaPoMe helpful for your research, we kindly ask that you consider citing the paper:

Kakouris, E.G. and Triantafyllou, S.P., 2017. Phase‚Äêfield material point method for brittle fracture. International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering, 112(12), pp.1750-1776.

## Authors

Emmanouil K. Kakouris and Savvas P. Triantafyllou (The University of Nottingham)

## Instructions

A template input file is provided in the folder Input. The path to the input file name to be run should be provided in the file InputAddressFile.inp. The coordinates of the material points have to be provided in a separate file "MatPoints.dat". 

### Remark

To use the code as a standard FE solver, switch the first variable under the $MATERIAL_POINT_METHOD key to 0, i.e., 0 1 60 0.02 0.02 0.00 0.00. In this case, the MatPoints.dat input file becomes irrelevant.
